## Usage

`PXButton` comes with a couple of neat features:

* `UIAppearance`-based font configuration
* An optional gradient behind your button that can look nice or old depending on how you use them
* The ability to display an image and a title with the image on the left or the right of the title
* The ability to inset the image in the button
* some shorthand methods for getting at the layer's border color, border width, and corner radius

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

PXButton is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "PXButton"
```
